        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          In the face of escalating challenges posed by the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires in California, there is an urgent need for
           innovative approaches to prediction and mitigation. California has witnessed devastating wildfire seasons, threatening lives, and causing extensive
            property damage. One main issue with predictions is the monitoring of wildfires, alongside a pressing demand for advancements in early detection systems. 
            Collaboration between government agencies, research institutions, and technology companies is essential for developing comprehensive strategies that integrate technologies with traditional firefighting methods.

          <h1>Objective</h1>
          <p> This project seeks to address these issues by using machine learning mechanisms. We will be using sattelite data that will predict
            if a wildfire is likely to occur based on certain conditions. The type of conditions that will be monitored with our data will be plant health, temperature of the surface of the earth, and 
            thermal anomalies. By using these methods, we aim to enhance the accuracy and timeliness of wildfire predictions, ultimately contributing to more effective preparedness, response strategies 
            and asolution to safeguard California's communities and ecosystems.

          <h1>Data Collection</h1>
          <p>
            For our project, we obtained a diverse array of data obtained from reputable sources, including the Application for Extracting and Exploring Analysis Ready Samples (AppEEARS) provided by NASA LP DAAC. This platform offered datasets for Bands 1 and 4 (BA), Elevation, Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), 
            and Temperature (TA) derived from MODIS and WELD products. We also incorporated California County Boundaries data from the California State Geoportal. Lastly, we also incorporated data from 
            wildfire incident reports from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE).</p>

            <h1>Prediction Models</h1>
              <p>
          The main feature of our wildfire prediction project handles the utilization of datasets to construct a comprehensive and reliable prediction model. By analyzing diverse sources of information, including plant health, temperature
          of earths surface, and thermal anomalies, we aim to be able to create a prediction model. Our model will be able to select a specific area in California and give a prediction of wildfire based on historical data. This model will be a map visualization of California that will be easily digestable for any user.
          This approach enables us to understand the historical context of wildfires but also to create a model with accuracy and timliness.
